React TypeScript Classes
=======================

experimentation with TypeScript and React 0.13 classes

### Usage:
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

## About
Demo to get up and running with TypeScript classes in React 0.13.

Scrapes some data off reddit and displays images in react components.

I plan to add plain es6 classes + flow in the near future.
